2 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.709
Hello.

3 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.910
So, the sociology class.

4 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.660
Sociology is a study of what, what kind of behavior.

5 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.890
Group behavior, so we've also studied the group what constitutes group, right? So now we're going to look at.

6 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.350
The effects of what's placed in your environment on the group.

7 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.390
Or when a group enters an environment. All right so that your, your topic today is human population ecology.

8 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.010
And environmental effects on human behavior.

9 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:06.595
Population human ecology is the study of the inter relationships between people and their environment. It is concerned with the study of the various groups that live together in time and space. How many different groups do we have living in Houston?

10 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
Scratch that how many representatives.

11 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:21.120
Of groups do we have in this class bother to get to know each other? What? What what who is representing what.

12 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.790
I said I'm taking class together and don't know these up.

13 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.440
Man environment is the surrounding or conditions in which a person lives, or operates.

14 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.130
So, we bring it down to a micro let's say this room is where we are living and where we got to operate.

15 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
What do we need in this room in this environment?

16 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.620
For you to live comfortably and operate comfortably.

17 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.010
Come on y'all make this in the rocket science. This is in your book.

18 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.110
Nobody know what to take to live bless your heart.

19 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.750
Do you need air? Why you only say that.

20 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.060
Do you need do you need to Aaron here to be hot or cold?

21 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.010
I asked, what do you needed to live and operate comfortably?

22 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.650
This type of error. Okay. All right beyond need somebody to come in here and start shooting.

23 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:44.700
You sure, thank you. Talk to me please what what you mean what do you need for your environment?

Need human interaction allowed about.

25 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.880
Branches now nobody going to talk to me.

26 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.050
There are various contributors from the environment on people's health and behavior.

27 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.650
We use each other as reference groups on how to act.

28 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.760
Some of those, some of us don't, but those that don't you need to start paying attention and other people how they're acting in this type of environment.

29 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.470
A lot of jobs, don't you don't you learn from people there's already been there how to how to do your job.

30 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.090
What to do what not to do what you can and can't get away with don't you do that?

31 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:46.020
If your environment is not conducive for comfortable living, you're not going to be comfortable. You're not going to learn the norms properly.

32 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:03:46.765 --> 00:04:01.735
one of the pressing concerns of lawmakers vote yesterday did y'all participate in the voting process because one of the pressing concerns of law makers is the pressing need for food clothing and shelter while preserving the environment

33 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.375
what type of environment are we living in

34 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.290
Here in Houston, Texas or well, we're not in Houston, but you know what I mean?

35 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.760
What kind of environment is this? Hmmm.

36 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.040
So, our economy is a capitalist economy. What do you know about capitalism?

37 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.769
Capitalism at its core gives you the right.

38 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:32.459
To make a profit without, or.

39 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:37.259
With without or little to no government interference.

40 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.769
Best capitalism in a nutshell.

41 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:49.049
Now, what does this mean since we're a man brought up environment or capitalism? What does this mean?

42 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:52.379
If you have a right to make a profit, what's going to happen to you.

43 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.889
Oh, thank you. You're going to be taking advantage of.

44 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.499
You're going to be coerced into doing something or buying something or participating in something that.

45 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:12.569
You don't really want to and you can't even do anything to stop somebody from making a profit off of, you.

46 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.569
I'll pay you on Bill for me you got a car? No, I'm the 1 person. Should have raised their hand.

47 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:24.179
Got a car note huh? Is it too high for you?

48 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:27.449
Also say too bad, right?

49 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:34.649
Because you would rather have it what you already got cars paying knows that when you would rather have what.

50 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:39.659
When you rather have it for free oh, oh, Lord. Help me.

51 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:46.859
I'll wake up now, I just ate a piece of candy, so I'm kind of wired up right now. Yeah, I'll catch up Whitney.

52 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:05:49.889 --> 00:06:01.529
Your car costs too much, don't it? But the person has sold it to you had every right in the world to sell it to you for that price and you'll agree to it because you wanted it.

53 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.149
Gas is too high in it, but you put, but you pay for the gas, don't you.

54 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:14.039
Because you need gas to make what run.

55 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.709
Food is too high in it, but you still buying it and eating it. Right?

56 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:24.179
Because you need it to work. All right.

57 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:30.179
So, these people that are in control of all of these things, people that own business, they can do this.

58 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:33.959
With little to no government interference.

59 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:38.429
Because these things that they're selling us, we need them.

60 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.799
Well, what is the other factors.

61 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:48.209
They go into the makeup of our society. What's in it?

62 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:11.399
All right. Okay some people feel they need to have a certain thing, or they deserve to live a certain lifestyle without putting forth the effort or working. Actually getting there.

63 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.949
What else is in our environment? Because I know you're old enough to pay attention now.

64 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:23.909
There's all kinds of entertaining. It's all entertainment. Good entertainment.

65 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.179
But there's all kinds of entertainment in our environment.

66 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:40.049
You gotta learn how to navigate through that and we're going to talk about some of those things and we're going to talk about a couple more things that's in our environment.

67 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:46.829
Let's talk about this, that's in our environment.

68 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:50.009
Gentrification urbanization and suburban nation.

69 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:59.909
Organization is when targeted groups of people are hurted htr D. D into slums or ghettos.

70 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:07.379
Then they are forced out or coerced out.

71 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:13.709
Of those by the usage of high, exorbitant rent.

72 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:20.159
I mean, I'll pay too much in rent. No, I do scares the hell out of me.

73 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:32.579
The only living together a little more. So, let me just ask you something. If you're living in a place that is charging way too much rent.

74 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:38.369
What you're going to do when you can't make the rent when they tell you got to go, what are you going to go?

75 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:44.429
Back home little mom, mom, mom.

76 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:50.759
Everybody has not everybody has options. So what happens to people that don't have an option.

77 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:58.409
Now, what's in our environment? Do you, I'll pay attention to the various laws.

78 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:01.499
That are in our environment.

79 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:07.379
What what what laws target? Homeless people, huh?

80 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:17.519
A lottery what else? What else you can't do.

81 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:23.519
They haven't posted on some of signs, not everywhere, but on some of the signs on the highway.

82 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:31.889
You can't ask for money, or you can't walk out into the traffic and ask, you know, how people come to you window that's against the law.

83 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:39.299
yes you you can't even camp out under some of the bridges

84 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:46.829
You know, you see people camping out, you can't camp out when you do that. These are called laws.

85 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:52.439
Yes, yes, yes.

86 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:09:53.639 --> 00:10:02.099
Pretty much now, our mayor well, I keep saying I live in Houston anymore the mayor of Houston.

87 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:10.799
When he helped introduce some of these laws stated, don't give these people money, but direct them to homeless shelters.

88 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:14.609
Now, what did we learn about the people that we see standing out there?

89 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:14.609 --> 00:10:18.659
Some of them prefer to live out there.

90 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.989
So go into a homeless shelter.

91 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:29.279
If you've never been guess what you gotta give them. No, you gotta give, em, your mate.

93 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:40.109
And guess what these some of these people don't want, man, I'm just trying to lay down for the night.

94 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

You got to tell me they're not trying to go through all of that.

95 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:50.639

96 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:59.129
Now, those people did living in urban areas.

97 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:02.129

98 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:06.419
Now, some people are coerced into the suburbs.

00:12:50.099 --> 00:12:56.939
The colony, and you can move out there and have a house for the same amount of money that you're paying in.

117 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:06.539
If you all, I'll get to a place or this 567 years, and somebody tell you that, and be sure to remember stay away from that because they're lying.

118 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:10.889
you can occupy that for that amount of money for about six months

119 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:14.069
After that the adjustable rate kicks in.

120 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:17.879
So, you go pay 600 dollars to pay 1200 dollars.

121 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:23.489
Then, in the next 6 or 7 months, you'll go from paying 1200 dollars to.

122 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:23.489 --> 00:13:36.389
1500 dollars and don't forget none of these places that you're moving to in the suburbs. You have to pay homeowners association fees per year. You also got to pay more or higher property taxes.

123 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:51.779
So, when we give them a man, why is a scam because we live where this is a capitalist society, everybody has a right to make a profit.

124 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:56.999
That's right. That's why you gotta be careful.

125 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:08.549
So is the movement of people from the central inner cities to smaller communities in their surrounding areas? We are in a suburban town.

126 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:17.519
Right now, Stafford, when you go back into the inner city.

127 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:20.819
Can you all see my cursor.

128 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:31.739
Let's say you were living there you meet you. We were living there and it wouldn't wouldn't at all at great because, you know, they paid pictures of the hood not being all that great.

129 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:43.049
But when we get there, we moved San, that adjustable rate mores. We went to the suburbs, and we can't get the house, but we still paying for that house by the way. Because you signed a contract.

130 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:47.069
So, you go back to the root cause in the hood is all way.

131 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:50.909
Good but now.

132 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:56.129
And I'm torn down, I'm a little low sack that we were living in and it's looking like this now.

133 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:11.759
Oh, sure Welcome back. Yeah. Right now it's 1200. what though what? I was only paying full on it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, we got to, you know, market price. Mm. Hmm.

134 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:15.629
We'd love to have you, but say, they know that you can't afford it.

135 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:20.909
2 ways they know you can't afford it. Number. 1 is your credit score?

136 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:20.909 --> 00:15:24.419
Because you just defaulted on all alone.

137 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:32.099
and you probably owe the homeowners association so they they probably ran that up you created a report too

138 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:41.639
Property taxes you still on the hook for that so that's all on your credit report. So, you know, you have a credit credit score of about what 6 on it.

139 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:47.639
Cause 700 is excellent or something like that now and then went from 600 to 200.

140 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:58.499
And they just look at you. Oh, wow. Well, we got a program for you to get into and help you build your credit score back up. Don't cut them out.

141 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:05.159
Because the only reason why you create a score is bad is because you were coerced.

142 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:08.489
Into something that you could not afford.

143 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:18.179
But this won't happen to y'all because I'll tell the professors and sociology class, and he's for warning you what's going to happen.

144 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:23.159
Right, if you see me out on the street, just roll by.

145 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:29.969
Yep, but if I see you on the street, I'm like, what you're doing that hey, you know, better than this.

146 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:33.539 --> 00:16:41.189
Justification is the settlement and renovation of run down inner city neighborhoods by a fluent newcomers.

147 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:46.439
They can afford to pay 1200 dollars to live in South part. Now.

148 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:53.009
And they want to live in places like South Park, 5th war, or 3rd or 4th war because it's closer.

149 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:57.539
So, they're higher paying jobs like the medical center.

150 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:03.779
Downtown areas yeah I've been downtown lately.

151 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:07.229
Built it up that night clubs and everything.

152 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:07.229 --> 00:17:13.109
They started doing that years ago and they say it for a specific reason to bring people back into the city.

153 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:24.149
We're dealing with overpopulation and there are consequences.

154 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:28.379
Living in an environment that is overpopulated.

155 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:28.379 --> 00:17:31.529
There will be more disease and illness.

156 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:34.919
there will be more medical

157 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:41.819
Of our society, meaning they'll give you medicine instead of curing you.

158 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:53.699
See, there's no profit in your cure there's profit in your pills that you got to take. Well, how do you how to do pills every 30 day? 60 days 90 days.

159 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:17:56.969 --> 00:18:03.269
Piggybacking on supply and God help you if you don't have insurance.

160 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:06.449 --> 00:18:14.069
I was taking a blood pressure medicine. It only costs me about 2025 dollars.

161 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:14.069 --> 00:18:17.999
But every 3 months I handle it.

162 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:23.489
But then I became unemployed at 1 point, lost the insurance.

163 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:26.879
Same blood pressure medicine. They later came back to me she said.

164 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:30.569
You you don't have any issues right now I'm paid for it.

165 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:35.729
And then my ignorance, she said, are you sure, sweetie? I say yeah.

166 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:43.199
Okay, she ran it up and I looked I got the bill appeals with 600 some odd dollars, huh?

167 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:52.649
What the Sweden I actually, you know, we have new programs here. I don't need to know my pride program.

168 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:58.199
But I had kept me because I started getting them headaches until we get in that program. So I get these patients.

169 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:18:58.199 --> 00:19:05.819
There are in equities in health care.

170 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:12.569
this goes all the way back to the plantation

171 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:17.009
I know you all get tired of me saying it, which I might want to start studying plantation like.

172 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:22.349
the the masters

173 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:31.169
Wouldn't listen to a lot of the slaves when the slaves complain that they were sick now, though human beings get sick from time to time.

174 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:35.789
White people you couldn't get sick, you were faking.

175 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:46.139
And the doctors were in on it, nothing wrong with anything wrong with Mel. So please get back on that field and get that get that working in.

176 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:51.719
2022 I learned this not too long ago.

177 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:59.759
Black women, y'all plan on having babies. Have you a great doctor because I've, this recently learned.

178 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:19:59.759 --> 00:20:06.509
Black women die the most out of all groups during childbirth. Yes, ma'am.

179 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:06.509 --> 00:20:13.289
You see, I'm not a woman, right? So, yes, I just learn that.

180 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:20.129
Seriously, I just wondered then it's like a whole.

181 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:26.429
I wouldn't know this has been going on.

182 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:31.769
They would like some type of alignment and that will help them, like, coordinate a blank labor.

183 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:35.129 --> 00:20:46.949
Told me that. Okay, no, no.

184 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:46.949 --> 00:20:54.329
Blood pressure most most of these, most of these mothers.

185 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:20:54.329 --> 00:21:00.329
Prior to giving birth, I'm talking about within a day or 2 where they have to perform a C section.

186 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:00.329 --> 00:21:06.119
They they got during childbirth or or they die soon after.

187 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:09.329
Because the doctors aren't paying attention to what the women.

188 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:18.719
Are complaining about real says it is how I learned real sad story, came on 60 minutes about a year or so ago.

189 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:26.699
Black couple bothers left to raise a baby long, and they had all these little pitches. They hadn't been married for 3 or 4 years.

190 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:34.829
She died during childbirth, right after she was complaining, kept going to the doctor and the doctor saying nothing wrong. She can't find nothing.

191 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:38.939
Hello just got muted. Yeah.

192 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:38.939 --> 00:21:44.309
Eliminated made me cry. I'm not really trying to.

193 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:47.249 --> 00:21:52.439
There are in equities in health care also.

194 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:55.709
If you are black and poor.

195 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:59.759
You're more likely not to have a.

196 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:04.199
Primary care physician, the emergency room.

197 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:10.919
Is your primary care physician cost 2 or 300 dollars a pop to go to the emergency room?

198 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:18.629
And this is what a lot of poor people do, and they are rude in the emergency room.

199 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:21.659
And they are crowded, backed up.

200 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:28.109
And they tend to treat people of color minorities the worst.

201 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:36.629
You know, don't want y'all to experience that that's why I keep telling you I mean, to read more. So you'll know it.

202 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:39.929
Just in case you need to go to the doctor.

203 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:41.069 --> 00:22:44.459
I want to get your primary care physician and some of them.

204 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:44.459 --> 00:22:47.519
Aren't worth nothing they just collected money.

205 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:58.469
You have to tell them I never heard that. It's still stupid that had a doctor. Tell me. Okay. What's wrong? Well, not feeling all good. Okay. Well, what else is wrong?

206 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:11.519
Basically, I just said they had told them how I was feeling. I didn't get no tone depressed. I didn't get the little thing and looking the ear up. He knows all that kind of crap. He just start prescribing medicine. Like, what is this for?

207 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:18.059
It's gonna help you feel better? I don't mean I don't feel right.

208 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:22.229
You'll be okay, you're a big guy.

209 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:25.349 --> 00:23:30.149
I ain't got me immediately, but then I had a doctor that was overweight.

210 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:37.829
And smoked, I like, dude. You can't tell me nuts. Yeah, I want to keep.

211 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

The job visit the healthcare today downstairs.

212 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:45.389 --> 00:23:54.569
Nobody the black lives studies cloth passed out pamphlets that were specific to what? Black people.

213 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:58.079
I stopped smoking.

214 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:05.219
Tell you people that smoke Menthol stop doing that the people that suck on them big as bottles within things calling.

No, no, no, not to wait. He stops working on them to the big bottles, which I'll go to the club and everybody think is cool. Now.

216 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

Came from another culture and you just yeah. Put your mouth on Sunday came from somewhere. You don't even know nothing about.

We got to stop 1st of all smoke. Doesn't belong in your lungs. If you don't believe we just go stand in front of a mirror and breathe. There's no smoke coming out of there.

218 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

What is called? Well, don't don't don't do it. That's not even smoke. That's that's your warm air hit and cold there.

219 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

A meteorologist's going to explain it better than I can.

220 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:24:48.899 --> 00:24:52.799
We, as as a people, we have to stop.

221 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:58.409
Doing a lot of things that we think is normal. Okay.

222 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:12.149
What about smoking? We only got my main. Why didn't you say? No, why can't you say nothing? I just want to wake you up.

223 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:16.349
Man, we're eating.

224 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:17.489 --> 00:25:24.059
Okay, we talk about it now consequences of overpopulation and their solutions.

225 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:25.379 --> 00:25:29.789
So, rapid population growth.

226 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:33.809
It's going to produce more than just what.

227 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:33.809 --> 00:25:41.009
Disease and illness, medical realization of our society and inequities in health care is also going to produce.

228 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:41.009 --> 00:25:44.249
Not enough food you got too many people.

229 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:45.449 --> 00:25:52.589
There's not, there's not gonna be enough housing and we learn affordable housing.

230 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:53.729 --> 00:25:57.149
Because I won't be enough schools. Good schools.

231 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:25:57.149 --> 00:26:00.209
There's not going to be enough jobs.

232 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:05.939
People need to work to earn money to pay for all this expensive stuff that we got to pay for.

233 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:07.229 --> 00:26:12.659
So, if there's not enough, what do you think the solutions will be?

234 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:19.109
And let me put it to you like this if you were a member of the dominant group.

235 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:20.249 --> 00:26:25.769
What would you do if your if your environment became too?

236 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.759
To overpopulated what would you do? Kill them? I didn't know.

237 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:33.329
Huh.

238 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:41.189
Thank you. I'm so glad I don't have to really today.

239 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:46.139
Come on now.

240 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:49.829
Okay.

241 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:49.829 --> 00:26:54.119
How many how many people do they get success when they get out of here? With corona?

242 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:26:54.119 --> 00:27:00.539
Over a 1Million people to me what was it? 3Million I think it was 3,000,000.

243 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:09.899
Hung around it. Well, it's still around, but round tough. What? 3 years.

244 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:17.159
You're right, increase the battery. Now, if you are not in the dominant group.

245 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:21.869
And here, let me say this, if you're not in the dominant group, you're not thinking.

246 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:26.099
You're not thinking the dominant group is thinking.

247 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:30.119
Remember the dominant ideology they're thinking.

248 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:34.379
They're thinking on how to stay in power we're thinking about.

249 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:40.169
How to get our next meal, how to get the next pair of shoes you just talking about some stuff? What are you talking about?

250 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:44.999
The next pair of shoes we're trying to get what's the club? That's what we're thinking about.

251 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:27:48.059 --> 00:28:02.934
It says decrease the birth rate, decrease it. Okay. And I'll keep talking about black people, but y'all don't feel me. I don't understand y'all know black people have been 13% of this population for over 100 years. Right? years right

252 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:03.209 --> 00:28:06.269
Mathematically, can you explain that.

253 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:09.719
For every 1 is born, that means what.

254 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:10.979 --> 00:28:14.969
One's dying to stay at 13.

255 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:24.029
Yes, ma'am. We are hey, no way.

256 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:34.649
Now, we got to figure out, but look, it's really not that hard because.

257 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:34.649 --> 00:28:38.279
How many black people do you know, are getting married?

258 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:42.839
How many people did, you know, are getting married? Stay married.

259 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:54.659
Okay, well, let me put it like this and I'm trying to be nasty, but how many men and women are getting together in the black community and making babies.

260 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:05.159
I'm thinking about the pictures factory for.

261 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:08.999
No.

262 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:13.289
More.

263 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:17.729
Oh, I know you're still going to push for even if you.

264 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:23.069
Really.

265 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:23.069 --> 00:29:29.219
Honestly, no, seriously, like, I know you have a choice.

266 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:29.219 --> 00:29:33.209
I see, because we can't get a.

267 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:39.629
But, no, no, no option.

268 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:39.629 --> 00:29:43.709
Still go ahead.

269 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:43.709 --> 00:29:46.709
They go back and forth.

270 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:46.709 --> 00:29:56.609
Yes, now the numbers also say that while women black women are dying during the chamber does not that many babies being born either.

271 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:04.619
That means both of them, because that's basically twice the.

272 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:11.759
And then the other black man, like, I feel like, come on, come on, go out and have kids.

273 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:17.639
Other people okay now, now flip it.

274 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:17.639 --> 00:30:25.589
Because it's because it's always a mirror, we're a mirror image of each other black man and black woman. We're mirror image.

275 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:29.369
There's a lot of sources that do that.

276 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:34.139
This is a dine in, so oh.

277 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:43.019
I know right well, my brother job yeah, Tom.

278 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:48.084 --> 00:30:53.934
Hold on, let me let me stop it right there because I'll let you talk freely. Y'all see what freely just float out.

279 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:30:58.049 --> 00:31:08.189
Oh, but that is what we're talking about, because the was the birth rate decreased. Why are we, this 13% for over a 100 years?

280 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:10.019 --> 00:31:17.939
These things are by design when y'all go home at night, don't know you, I'll probably don't watch TV watch watch an hour television.

281 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:21.329
Just an hour. Okay just an hour.

282 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:29.429
Well, hell, what's 30 minutes and see how many commercials come on where there are mixed couples.

283 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:29.429 --> 00:31:37.799
Oh, it's not a, there's nothing wrong with falling in love, but.

284 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:49.049
I'm trying to talk about in the black community. We're only 13% and we've been at 13% for over a 100 years and they do a census every 10 years.

285 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:52.739
Census, that's where they come and count you.

286 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:57.359
C. N. S. U. S. you can see you'll see the word in a minute.

287 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:03.389
The dominant group has the power to carry out all these solutions.

288 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:07.919
They will inspire migration. Are you out here for 2 o'clock or 4? 0.

289 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:07.919 --> 00:32:13.019
By 4 o'clock, that's that's the president, right there. Wave them. Do.

290 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:26.879
404040 PM you came early before they changed the little thing venue for come 4 o'clock.

291 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:33.329
We got because we need your help, we need your help coming back at 4 o'clock. I'm teaching class right now, so I'll come back and forth.

292 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:33.329 --> 00:32:36.599
No problem no problem. No problem.

293 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:38.249 --> 00:32:45.569
Produce more cheap, inferior food production right? Write these videos down.

294 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:47.189 --> 00:32:51.419
Day to day.

295 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:54.479
For oh, wow.

296 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:54.479 --> 00:32:59.009
You seen it before? Yes. It's a nasty and it's on your.

297 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:32:59.009 --> 00:33:04.679
If you get it.

298 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:12.479
And look watch these films because it's about the food production in the United States. There's no way you're going to get around it.

299 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:19.049 --> 00:33:24.719
Like, a live point, remember that was trying to.

300 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:26.339 --> 00:33:30.629
Well, let me, let me let me let me flow you all along.

301 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:39.779
Inspire migration from an overpopulate Erickson unpopulated area. Now I just mentioned to you. Maybe I did. I'm getting my classes mixed up. Stafford.

302 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:42.779
Was dusty Katie was dusty.

303 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:46.349
Parallel was dusty when I moved here in 98.

304 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:46.349 --> 00:33:50.489
All this stuff is blended sneaky healthy. Now.

305 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:50.489 --> 00:33:56.909
Because they're moving people out moving people out.

306 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:04.559
and remember it was that the suburbs was made to be this is the place to be handling the severity

307 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:08.099
You know, you have your professors opinion. This is a trap.

308 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:12.779
To get you out the city.

309 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:19.229
Say, what.

310 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:19.229 --> 00:34:27.689
Because you said the thing with that thing what I can't hear you. Oh, she said that that talks about things and now they want to go back, but yeah, but they don't want.

311 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:27.689 --> 00:34:32.279
They want us is in the city.

312 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:37.139
And look, y'all didn't pay attention to this campaign.

313 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.799
Season busy Republicans.

314 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:40.799 --> 00:34:44.969
All they talking about is the economy.

315 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:50.969
In crime, who do you think they talk about when they talk about crime?

316 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:55.739
Blacks, so.

317 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:01.139
All of these people that say, we need to get, we need to get these Democrat judges out in a soft don't crime.

318 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:09.359
They want people in place that's gone. Now what happens to you if you break the law, whether you get to go back into.

319 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:14.519
Slavery or to the 13th amendment.

320 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:17.009 --> 00:35:27.239
So, you can go to jail for low stuff and get you in probation. I forget the percentage of black Americans that are involved in the penal system.

321 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:42.389
But it's a lot when we're talking about population, we're talking about population control. We have to talk about controlling the population.

322 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:47.519
Who's trying to stay in power which group.

323 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:52.259
So, these control policies aren't aimed at the dominant group.

324 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:35:53.849 --> 00:36:05.099
Hearing me, the United States keeps track of its population by conducting a census. There's a word for you again every 10 years.

325 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:09.269
And recording changes and vital statistics.

326 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:13.169
Those were vital things that are needed to live.

327 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:14.669 --> 00:36:17.819
These things are also referred to as demographics.

328 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:19.259 --> 00:36:26.639
They want to know everything about you as much about you every 10 years.

329 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:31.499
So they'll know what groups are dying and what groups are growing.

330 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:39.689
The groups that are growing are we okay with that? Sure. Leave them alone. The groups that are growing. Are we okay with that? No. Well, you got to do something about that.

331 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:40.769 --> 00:36:44.969
They're thinking, we're not thinking, remember that game with this.

332 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:49.709
We react, they're acting.

333 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:49.709 --> 00:36:54.629
We react what you got on your mind, what's your concerned with.

334 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:58.919
And get my degree, so I could be a lawyer so you can do what? With that.

335 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:06.539
5 foot equity and equal justice, or just make some money. So you can go live in the suburbs.

336 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:10.709 --> 00:37:15.749
Hopefully, you will become a sociologist where you do a lot of reading, because sociologists are aware.

337 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:15.749 --> 00:37:26.334
That the norms values and social patterns of a society profoundly affect various elements of the population, like birth and death rates, migration, marriage rates,

338 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:26.364 --> 00:37:30.834
employment rates and religious philosophies.

339 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:38.969
I am me okay what the that was so bad.

342 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:01.499
Could you just tell you free is able to charge you everything?

343 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:03.089 --> 00:38:07.229
What did carry urban do? That was so bad.

344 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:07.229 --> 00:38:14.160
He shared a book. Did did he did he give him.

345 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.120
An opinion about it, or did he just share it?

346 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:24.120
I got 1 more free. What did he do that was so bad?

347 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.460
Hey, Kevin. Hey, that's something.

348 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:36.900
Nick cannon does not have too many kids because Nick cannon is rich and can take care of all of them. Why? Nobody saying nothing about the 10 different women.

349 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:44.760
Don't nobody want to go there? That's what I when I say thinking, I didn't have any numbers as well.

350 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.260
That's the money, so people that we have to.

351 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:38:49.260 --> 00:39:01.590
Why is he acting the fool? Because, because he's rich and can take care of his kids is men out there that they only have 1 key and Kate take care of it and don't show up for it.

352 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

353 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:23.160
Oh, okay. Nobody get here.

354 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.570
No, I get her through a woman.

And Nick can, and I know no cleanses theme fella and he popular.

356 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

357 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.090
And he said he's trying to marry, he wanted to man, you want to stay with Maria.

358 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:55.050
You will play a, you know, I'm talking about no, I'm talking about what they really after what they really have.

359 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:59.640
They really have to use for the money come on now. How they're too boy. Yeah.

360 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.910
Neon Dion been saying since the 80 s must be the money.

361 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.940
Because what, because what does Nick Canon have to do with all of them? Kids?

362 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:18.240
He got to pay child support, he got to take care of him and he's rich. He can do that.

363 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.020
So, come on now, we're not going to doubt the man that can handle it.

364 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.450
We're not going to talk about a broke, man, because the broadband has always talked about.

365 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:32.430
We talked about McKenna and that's not even what MC Canon got in trouble for.

366 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:37.080
Y'all hear me, you already know what Nick Kevin got in trouble for.

367 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.310
For saying that we are the original Jews.

368 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:47.220
Most black people know this.

369 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:52.410
I don't know. Yeah, we professor Griff.

370 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:40:53.610 --> 00:41:02.610
now let's see i'm broadcast in here and if somebody can take this and if somebody wants to do it some of y'all to do y'all going to take it to the higher ups

371 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:12.360
I will be put under scope maybe even fired a release for agreeing with that. But again, most black people know.

372 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.560
That the original Hebrews were black and.

373 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.420
We're going to talk about something in a minute as to why other? A lot of black people don't know it.

374 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.720
And other people don't want us to know it.

375 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.890
But 1st, let's talk about this, man. Come on. Y'all use your thinking caps.

376 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:44.100
What year was he born? Come on what's your American history? What was going on in 70,966?

377 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:51.960
Oh, Lord, y'all hill. Y'all need hill. There was slavery going on.

378 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.170
But this wasn't even a country yet.

379 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.170
These were still 13 colonies.

380 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:02.160
Still belong to England and 1 or 2 was France.

381 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:09.480
When did it come on now?

382 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:19.080
What else give me some more American history he died before slavery.

383 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.790
30 years before slavery ending. So what did this, man know his whole life?

384 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:34.020
Can you tell what Racey is? What's he? Yeah, he was not a slave.

385 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.470
He was a writer, he was also a minister.

386 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:53.310
And a scientist 1 of the 1st, laws of population in college is the exponential law of population growth. This stage of the population will grow exponentially very fast, increasing rapidly as long.

387 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:42:53.310 --> 00:43:01.620
As the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant for it to happen.

388 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.740
So you can only reproduce if your environment.

389 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:17.550
Will allow you to reproduce what I tell you, the law makers we're concerned with 1 of the things that they were concerned with.

390 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:23.550
Food the gap between food supply and population will continue to grow.

391 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.530
Who has to be planted or manufactured to keep up with the population growth.

392 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:36.930
Therefore, since food is an essential component to human life population growth in any area, or on the planet, if unchecked.

393 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.440
Would lead to starvation, so.

394 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:51.300
Thomas Malthus came up with this brilliant idea. He said there are preventative checks and positive checks on population.

395 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:56.850
That slow its growth and keep the population from rising exponentially.

396 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:03.030
Meaning too fast or too long, but he said there was still be poverty.

397 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:09.630
Cause at that time, every white person wouldn't rich and wealthy.

398 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:23.160
uh only the rich slave owners old slaves so a lot of white people were what they called indentured servants

399 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.950
They hired themselves out for, you know, contract for a year or 2 or 7.

400 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.490
Is that kind of like this year property was and.

401 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:39.480
No, no, yeah, I got studies sharecropper wouldn't then like an adventure server to.

402 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.240
So, let's do this, let's take this route.

403 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.170
Let's examine the connection between food and sex since.

404 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:58.920
The act of sex is how we all got here human nature, causes population problems because sexual urges.

405 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:06.810
Known as the Beatles would lead to reproduction, causing people to produce more rapidly than food production.

406 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.610
This is not professor is this is this science this is straight like it is.

407 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:20.520
So, y'all bear bear with me, but she'll put your maturity hat on.

408 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:26.250
Okay, is your maturity at all? Can we all agree to sex is an activity.

409 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:32.520
6 takes energy, what does your body need to have proper energy to do anything?

410 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.270
What does it need to have?

411 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.330
Now, if you're.

412 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:44.850
If you're diet at the end of the week, looks like this.

413 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.420
You sluggish.

414 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:55.290
You crap that sugar and salt are addicted to the human brain.

415 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:45:55.290 --> 00:46:05.970
Your brain produces hormones called dopamine and serotonin double means where we get the word dope from dope is what gets you railed up and excited.

416 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:12.000
Your brain produces it naturally and don't use your alarm in the morning.

417 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.940
And watch your body wake you up at the same. It's a point of time.

418 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.660
Right.

419 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:30.180
You're asleep and all of a sudden your body, your body's still working when you're asleep and your body will say, okay.

420 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.890
She's been laying down and resting and sleeping too long. Get her up.

421 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:44.280
And you, what? The 6 o'clock? Well, I'm going to try to get up till 630. your body's the most time you get up now.

422 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:50.280
Naturally dopamine hormone, serotonin.

423 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.310
Is what some of you are feeling right now?

424 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.170
With you to sleep, that's serotonin.

425 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.790
You will fall to you will fall asleep naturally.

426 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:12.960
When your body says a breath retired, I don't know where you're going to be, but we've got to shut this down. So you might want to here. You might want to get somewhere.

427 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:20.310
And you start yawning because your body automatically starts reducing the amount of oxygen that you're taking in.

428 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:28.770
And your body rest of your body starts getting ready to go to sleep it's just waiting on you to say, okay, I'm going to lay down.

429 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:35.220
How long does it take any of you to actually fall off to sleep after you quote unquote? Get sleepy.

430 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.390
You lay down in that.

431 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:43.590
I would think that means you got stress.

432 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:54.330
yeah naturally when your body started telling you it's time to sit down and usually takes about five or ten minutes where you just dreaming yeah

433 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:47:55.195 --> 00:48:10.045
Anybody ever had surgery anybody a surgeon meditate that stuff they put in you go put your sleep probably by they take the count from TM backwards. You don't even remember you only remember 8 next thing, you know, you waking up time.

434 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:17.430
I had a cold and asked me and I was like, whoa, what happened? What really happened.

435 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.420
Hey, that's naturally your body does that.

436 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.190
And you and it will not you will not wake up unless you're disturbed.

437 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.190
Now, these hormones control our mood.

438 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:39.390
It's a good okay. I mean, don't mean or serotonin the kicking in.

439 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:53.880
So a lot of the fast foods and bad foods that we eat are called comfort foods. Come on. Let me see, I've been doing this for 15 years. Come on. Let me see her record right here. Yeah.

440 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:06.630
Ladies, when your boyfriend, a treat you right? Or you get sad, are you watching them alone? You know, what is it hallmark movies would you like to eat on? Can I take a guess?

441 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:11.880
More than likely.

442 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:17.430
Is going to be something chocolate or some ice cream.

443 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:30.600
God, let me see if I'm on point. Let me see if I'm on point and you and girls. Okay. I recognize that, but we do get a little well, we'd like to do. We like to snack.

444 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.050
Make us feel a little better.

445 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.410
When we split the beans.

446 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:41.400
Hello.

447 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.510
See, how to women don't respect us? Well, with.

448 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:52.680
Men when we get depressed, if we're drinking age.

449 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.160
Alcoholic Beverage mostly beer.

450 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.300
Or pizza and chips.

451 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:07.680
Okay.

452 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:16.410
Their comfort foods, but they're all everything that we just made because men have different hormone.

453 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:23.010
Levels then women, we're different. Our hormones are different.

454 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:27.900
And have way more estrogen women have way more what it was it.

455 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:35.550
Men have way more testosterone women, you have to test the wrong, but you have way more estrogen than we do.

456 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:41.460
So a lot of these fools there were eat, have been injected and constructed with hormones.

457 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:51.030

462 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.680
Then now what we need to do.

463 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:51.865

466 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:59.010
Cells they are alive, you are alive.

467 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.820

469 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:18.480
Oh, you're you're you're getting ahead. You're getting ahead.

Okay, if you can't stand it, you eating the wrong foods.

474 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

If you're having problems, or if you in there, you eating the wrong.

475 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:16.740
When you eat the right fools, this helps keep us free from bacterial disease and stress related diseases, such a stroke.

476 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:20.550
Heart disease organ failure, et cetera. Now.

477 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:29.970
Yes, you do need to do some research about what is being sold to you in your grocery stores.

478 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:36.060
Now, if you really go and do your research, you're going to find that the organic.

479 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:42.900
The organic cost them, they're 10 times more than what they have out.

480 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.580
In about every fruit and vegetable.

481 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:52.110
It's supposed to have a little stay up on it. A little sticker.

482 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:55.620
Don't inquire to the manager what it is.

483 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:02.430
Inquire of the FDA, federal drilling food administration what? That stamp and you might be surprised.

484 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:09.540

All right now.

486 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

491 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:58.740
To put in work and it might not be right.

492 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:02.310
If somebody got to take a shot of alcohol.

493 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:13.770
Somebody got a sip on some line if you, if you in your thirties in early for this, and you pop in blue pills, like skills.

494 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.600
Come on now, why would you think of that?

495 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:25.770
Watch what's what you're putting into your body.

496 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:29.880
Because we're talking about reproduction.

497 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.380
If your body and functioning correctly.

498 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:39.930
You ain't going to reproduce correctly come on now.

499 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:44.610
What's your maternity hat on? If you always getting sick?

500 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:50.070
Do you think your baby going to cause you passing on.

501 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.970
Your genes which are insufficient, because you didn't eat right?

502 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:55:53.970 --> 00:56:01.440
How many y'all seen that people have babies and the babies of fat.

503 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:07.800
And when I'm talking about fat, I'm talking about overweight or obese, and the baby come out this, this.

504 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.960
Not a baby is 8,000 word baby, getting all that fat from.

505 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.660
I get it from mom and day.

506 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:26.040
You see a family full of overweight people come on now.

507 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:29.070
What's what's your eating?

508 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:32.970
It's not hard to watch what you're eating.

509 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:46.560
It might be slightly expensive and it is and it is tempting because you can get a, what double cheeseburger at McDonalds for dollar 18, and get a salad for that same amount of cost you 20 dollars.

510 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:55.080
But you can't go to the grocery store, do your research get you some fresh fruits and vegetables make your own salad.

511 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:02.820
Stop drowning in salad dressing, read the labels. I noticed that he always talks about reading some. Yes, I am.

512 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:12.990
Because your life is dependent on it, especially if you're a member of the black race, because we've been at 13 freaking fracking percent for all 100 years. That ain't right.

513 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:18.270
Being very underway.

514 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:24.120
Come on now, look, if somebody real thin, don't you look at something was wrong with them.

515 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:29.010
They own the pipe was wrong with them. They got they got that thing. What's wrong? Mm. Hmm.

516 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:33.330
What that is fine.

517 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:37.680
Overweight or nourish can possibly cause what it say.

518 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:46.530
A low libido, that's your sex urge due to disruptions in normal hormone levels. Now everybody is born with the libido.

519 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:51.780
Now, once you don't know, or may not realize about libido, you have no control over it.

520 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:57:51.780 --> 00:58:02.430
It will kick on using girls round 111,213, right? When you start having your no, ma'am sex urge.

521 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:06.960
The urge to, but see, at that age, you don't know what that is.

522 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:14.250
Boys by around 911, what's happening down there?

523 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:23.760
You all know what's going on. That's your that's your libido kicking in but your son is such a young age. You don't know what is going on.

524 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:32.130
If you would like to use that word, I'm teaching, I'm teaching class so it's libido.

525 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:35.730
It's a libido, if you want to use that word.

526 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:47.160
You could use that word, but it's a libido. Everybody has 1 now to finish this part off. You don't get to dictate when it comes on and guess what you, what else you don't get to dictate.

527 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:56.430
When it goes away now when you're young and it's libido get kicked in, guess what you need.

528 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:58:56.430 --> 00:59:03.510
You need your parents to explain to you what is going on with your body.

529 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:08.100
And then we talked about this if your parents.

530 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:16.260
Don't know nothing what you're going to know. So, this is why we have teenage boys and girls.

531 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.890
Middle age in the middle age, middle school age.

532 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:24.270
Coming up pregnant and got diseases.

533 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:29.100
Cause they paid sorry I must say it so got diseases because they don't know.

534 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:34.140
So this is what we talk about inappropriate and inadequate socialization.

535 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:39.240
You see the 1213 year girls, pregnant mom. I don't know nothing.

536 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:47.820
You look at the baby healthy parents ought to be looking good and healthy.

537 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:04.320
This is also evidence there's also evidence to support the specific foods high in salt sugar and salt have an effect on libido. Okay this is also true. Some people can't have sex until after they eat.

538 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:08.880
After.

539 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:15.090
I can't, I can't go down the line and specifically tell you who certain people can't have sex.

540 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:26.820
so i'm guessing these things have an effect on your libido

541 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:33.690
Like, sex drive, dear yes, horny. Yes. All of that stuff that you want.

542 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:40.230
No, you're libido kicks in at a certain age and then it.

543 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:43.980
Leave at a certain age. Oh.

544 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.740
So, in the meantime, and in between time, your libido can be messed with and altered.

545 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:55.440
Based on what you're eating, based on an environment that you're living in.

546 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:02.490
Yes, people can mess with your libido. You get around the wrong person.

547 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.730
Then you want libido will be directed at what that person.

548 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:10.500
Introduced you to oh, which makes it you.

549 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:18.420
Which makes you do some wrong, quote, unquote, wrong things or not normal things.

550 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:24.420
Yeah, I've heard a pornography, right?

551 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:27.900
Yeah.

552 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.190
This is a 1Billion dollar industry.

553 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:40.050
Y'all hear me a lot of lot of it is computer generated imagery.

554 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:44.400
But it's directed at.

555 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.400
And the women get younger.

556 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.610
And or made to look young.

557 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:01:50.610 --> 01:02:00.810
And then there are boys involved, there's a fetish talk about the wrong person, getting ahold of you. They want a big, strong girl. They won't be able to see you take all that off.

558 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:04.170
They want you to look like a little boy or a little girl.

559 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:08.850
That'll failure is coming back.

560 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:23.070
On the rise. Okay, you'll need to do your research and y'all need to start reading up on some of these stories. These case studies where young boys and 13 are telling their story.

561 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:26.460
Why they can't get passed.

562 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:29.460
Being with another boy.

563 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:40.980
And these girls lead listen to their case studies on why they keep engaging in risky behavior. A lot of stuff happens to children when they're young and they can't remember.

564 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:49.830
What do you know when you're born? How far back can you remember? I mean, a vivid memory how far back can you go with a vivid memory?

565 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:56.100
Okay, so if somebody has gotten a hold of you.

566 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:00.570
And at that around that agent, you think it's normal.

567 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:07.620
Guess what kind of adult you turn into we're talking about socialization here.

568 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.710
And some socializations can be in adequate and appropriate.

569 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:30.570
Let's get back to Thomas Malthus, according to Thomas mouth, is there are 7 things you can introduce into a society's environment slash ecosystem to insure a decline.

570 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:34.110
Or slow down the growth of its population.

571 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:38.820
Those 7 things are poverty I'm going to be thought.

572 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.340
You'll lack of money was based on your effort who controls money.

573 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:52.140
With group, so if they control money, they're going to also control the groups or the amount of money that goes into groups.

574 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:56.220
Certain groups and don't we need money?

575 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.110
What we need money for? Don't we need to buy fresh fruits and vegetables?

576 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:10.110
but when we look in our neighborhoods how many fresh fruits and vegetable stores and grocery stores are there versus how many fast food restaurants

577 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:29.035
Oh, thank you. Somebody's woke somebody woke now they don't like you because you're woke y'all listened to them and political air campaigns. Thanks to the woke agenda.

578 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.790
Hello.

579 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:42.060
The stash data switch state of Texas, turning into California, California. What's wrong? With California? We come on now.

580 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:51.600
Misery now we're talking about this man, I say this is what you can put into a group.

581 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:04:51.600 --> 01:05:00.810
Yeah, now, what do people what do people go get miserable about? What is that every day?

582 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:04.110
Poverty not having enough.

583 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:08.130
And the United States keeps a misery index.

584 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:23.070
A misery index they want to keep up with, hey, who the hell is miserable. This week we hit. Did we get them? Did we give them? Because when you're miserable what more than likely are you going to commit.

585 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:28.860
I was thinking about.

586 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:41.670
Deviant behavior. Same, same thing is it's not normal to kill yourself. Even though somebody may get mad. Go kill yourself. Don't do that. That's not normal.

587 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:44.850
Why is it that way?

588 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:49.500
They're in a state of enemy.

589 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.540
oh whatever whatever they knew as a norm

590 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.780
It's no longer there or it's become blurred.

591 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:01.050
And they start abusing themselves.

592 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:04.140
and eventually leads to suicide i went over this which are

593 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.510
Rich.

594 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:16.350
I know you had a board member taking baby money and everything money and everything.

595 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:22.530
you just need enough money to just take care of you said you don't need money to

596 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:27.840
and some people don't have family but they got a lot of money they're miserable

597 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:38.520
This is the people that got a lot of money, but don't have friends they can trust or people that they call friends aren't really their friends not only there for 1 thing and they know it.

598 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:47.040
Disease this is bad too.

599 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:06:47.040 --> 01:07:00.930
of all minority groups african americans have the most and many times the largest differences in health risk when compared to other minority groups african americans have more disease disability in early beth as well

600 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:04.440
Cause they expect us to work through our pain and suffering.

601 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.830
This this is coming back from the plantation.

602 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:14.190
you weren't allowed to be sick you if you got pregnant you still had to pick your your quota

603 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:17.490
or sugar k little cotton you get me

604 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:22.260
They did a whole put your bill in that hole down there and stretch you out and put behind.

605 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.580
And I'm hoping like, your mom would give you, they put people to, uh.

606 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.790
what do you call them

607 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:40.650
Sickle cell is on a heart disease and diabetes. Those comes directly from your diet.

608 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.190
these are the things that are killing blacks the most asthma

609 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:53.490
Most impoverished neighborhoods are downwind of the industrial complexes or land fields.

610 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:07:53.490 --> 01:08:06.840
So your mom and then breathe any of that stuff, and then they get together and make babies with you and now you got to ask them you can't even breathe and you've got other low allergens and allergies that you can ward off.

611 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:16.500
Hiv HIV AIDS, y'all.

612 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:25.380
Originally, y'all might young might be too young, but I was, I was living, I was a teenager when 1st hit the news.

613 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:30.840
I want to know where it came from, or what they told us right?

614 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:39.120
It was, it was a gay white man's disease, because at the time, only gay white men.

615 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:45.630
hey this virus then by the time i graduated high school

616 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:52.770
I was a black black man in Africa that was having sex with green monkeys. That's where the HIV came from.

617 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:58.560
It was like a recent thing I came from, sir.

620 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:12.030
In the United States in 99,281.

621 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:19.770
Rock Hudson who lady who's your favorite entertainer is like you just who is he?

622 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.020
That's what rocco's said was to women. What do you do?

623 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:28.440
He had this mysterious disease.

624 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:39.450
Rock Hudson was the man's man guys who what after we kind of, you know, we look like we might look like, but we want to be. We think it's cool as hell.

625 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:45.300
What after Rock Hudson was that do.

626 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.160
He was that he was that pin poster for the women.

627 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:59.100
alright but he come down with his mystery illness the doctors couldn't figure out what the hell was going on he was dying quickly

628 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:12.540
Family members coming in, and nobody knows what's going on. So the doctors was a team of doctors. This is a story I'm recalling from memory. What is going on so, 1 of the doctors decided let's test to see if it's hereditary.

629 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:20.340
So, they tested all the family members nothing then 1 of the doctor's notice certain guys were coming to see him.

630 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:35.790
Certain certain can I have you guys permission to test your blood? Sure. No problem. Is it a hill ROM? Yes, it's the hill ROM. They noticed the same virus in their blood.

631 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:49.830
I think it was 3 men that were coming to see rockets. They noticed the same virus was in their blood. So, I guess now through a series of talking, that's how they found out. Rock Hudson was gay.

632 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:10:53.550 --> 01:11:03.300
Cause you can't really look at somebody and tell they gay you might think what you're looking at, but you, you can't.

633 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:10.710
That's why they had to have a talk and right after that they started testing members of the community.

634 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:13.830
And guess what they kept coming up with.

635 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:17.670
White man, gay.

636 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.370
And, like I said, that was 10th grade by the time I graduated.

637 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:30.060
Oh, it came from a black man, having sex with monkeys in Africa somewhere.

638 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:33.810
So so, did these white may go to Africa to have sex with this man?

639 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.260
and then by the time we got to be young adult

640 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.920
4Million people died of AIDS yesterday in Africa.

641 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:51.360
This is back in the eighties. I wouldn't even born yet, so I can't explain everything. Yeah.

642 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.090
The 90 s it was it was just sky high.

643 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:02.670
And then it became the, by the time I was probably 25 or 30.

644 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.290
H, I V became the fastest.

645 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:10.680
Killer in the black community.

646 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:18.330
In America and black women were the group that was obtaining HIV the fastest.

647 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:25.380
The webinar.

648 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

652 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.960

Health the top hill official.

655 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:13.950
In France, this new said this on TV, we need to come up with a vaccine and we need to start testing right away and we need to start it in Africa.

660 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:41.070
A lot of people in villages.

661 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.730
Right, right?

662 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:13:49.645 --> 01:14:01.255
Okay, I'm test I'm broadcasting, so let's go on we hit number 3 then we're talking about things to put into a community to slow it down. This is Thomas mouth. This was his suggestions.

663 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:15.870
Deteriorate the morals of that community now before you start passing judgment on me about these pitchers, why don't you read what morality is? What the definition is.

664 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.630
From the Latin moralitas meaning manner.

665 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:24.990
Character proper behavior.

666 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:25.345 --> 01:14:35.515
Morality is the differential differentiation of intentions, decisions and actions between those that are good, or right.

667 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:35.665 --> 01:14:43.105
And those that are bad or wrong for the individual and society. Do you remember what society means?

668 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:51.270
that place where you live in work we're still talking about environment so let's see what's been placed in our environment and see if it's good or bad

669 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:14:55.830 --> 01:15:00.450
It's good for young man. Is this good for women?

670 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

Oh, man, that's a little Wayne, like a whole bunch of girls on his face. That is that good?

671 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

All right? All right.

672 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

Okay all right. Is this good or bad?

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:35.910
Okay, okay now.

677 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)

You didn't read you didn't read the whole definition not normal is bad.

678 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:47.580
What do what do we just get to discussing that the human body means.

679 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.800
Fresh fruits and vegetables.

680 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.580
If you're eating a healthy diet tea and she's not promoting healthy diet. What do you see? What did you say.

681 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:10.470
Being comfortable that means settling for this. I'm here for me, I did say that. Did yeah.

682 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:15.900
Had a basket don't do anything.

683 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.700
The definition is, is is this good or bad?

684 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:25.560
For the individual and or society.

685 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:33.570
Now, I don't know, but I don't understand why somebody would want to polls half naked and then put it on the Internet.

686 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:40.140
So, for me personally, I mean, I'm sorry for anybody.

687 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:49.440
I don't know why, but I do know that she did get on the Internet and start whining and complaining and crying about not having a man.

688 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:58.710
Yo, be for real and read the definition.

689 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:02.610
Is this good for our society?

690 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:07.650
Is it good for an individual.

691 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:12.630
Listen to what you're saying.

692 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:19.500
Listen to what you're saying, you don't want to listen to what you're saying. So, let's let's switch it up.

693 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:25.230
Is prostitution good if somebody's if somebody's comfortable with.

694 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:40.495
It depends everybody's comfortable. Y'all. Y'all was still missing the point. The definition is about morals is a good or bad for the individual or society.

695 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:44.670
21, it's kind of different or like.

696 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:49.890
My man here said, isn't everybody's morals different? Yes.

697 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:54.930
The 1 might be might be yes.

698 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:17:55.645 --> 01:18:09.295
So, let me, let me no, no big. 3rd there aren't we there? Are you focusing on her individual? We're not talking about this.

699 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:09.295 --> 01:18:14.215
Cause it's more than people out here doing things that it's not good for the society. society

700 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:20.520
These are just examples. Don't don't just focus on her.

701 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:27.390
Well, see that she decides to do that.

702 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:31.740
Because that's how it be.

703 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:41.460
Everybody wants the media and I want to. Do you ever wonder how come nobody got this deal with the brother with all the women in the bed.

704 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:41.815 --> 01:18:50.665
Because nobody cares, I'd like to say again, if you let people talk freely, you get the full understanding.

705 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:50.965 --> 01:18:57.804
1 is acceptable, but the other is not always funny and it goes to what you just said.

706 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:11.100
Everybody has different morals and we're not talking about different people with different morals. We're talking about morality being a certain type of morality being placed within a group of people.

707 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:18.720
Is this going to be helpful? Oh, let me put this them. Give you some more context by people.

708 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.840
13% over 100 years.

709 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.720
Hello, we're only 13% of the total population for over a 100 years.

710 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:34.260
Think about that that long that means that every 1 of us that is born 1 person is dying.

711 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:38.010 --> 01:19:42.150
Good deal math partitions.

712 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:47.310
Now, Here's some mills that started happening in the, in the community.

713 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:51.810
Wives, we started wanting to put stripper poles in the home.

714 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:19:54.090 --> 01:20:01.350
Yeah, no, I, I really don't mind.

715 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:04.950
What.

716 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:10.920
So, if you just let people talk freely.

717 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:20.070
Can I tell you what? I think this is not a good idea. Especially if you're married in that case.

718 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:24.090
If you're if you're married.

719 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:30.930
And you put a scribble poll what's the reason for putting it in your home? Just for your okay. Okay.

720 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:34.140
Hey, all right now.

721 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.750
Has anybody been to a strip club? Um.

722 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:48.780
I'll do the men, how does it mean? And I'm going to guide you long. How did the men treat and react to the women?

723 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:54.120
The flexibility they treat.

724 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:05.070
I have a respectful way. Yeah well, it's your money so they have oh, yeah, this is slavery.

725 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:07.795 --> 01:21:20.785
Can I ask you? Do you all know what that is? That's objectification. So I have a question for you if you're married. Is that how you want your husband treating you? Like you're an auditor.

726 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:21.090 --> 01:21:28.530
Just throw money into let me look into it. Love the idea. I hear it personally.

727 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:37.110
I can't see you were talking about morals we're talking about morals. That's why the definition is down there.

728 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:43.800
Don't care if that's what you like to go do we're talking about. Is this good for a group.

729 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:49.230
Or society, now, the next thing that I have up there is a Bible.

730 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:54.750
Exactly. How many have you read the Bible?

731 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:59.700
This is where you get your moral, your religion.

732 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:10.890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, because there are people my manager said there are people with different morals. They also lead churches.

733 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:14.010
And they're telling people don't listen to this part.

734 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.140
Yeah, are you thinking that the backlog.

735 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:28.320
No, no.

736 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:39.630
So that's so that's imagery. Right? How many how many of you have been to.

737 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:43.230
Nobody's ever been nobody's ever been to heaven.

738 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:50.460
You don't know, but the imagery is there to scare you to behave a certain way.

739 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:56.250
Hello, this is about morals.

740 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:22:56.250 --> 01:23:02.040
And how other how another group can control the behavior of another group.

741 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.490
Well, it sold the dominant rate, put this.

742 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:12.090
Oh, well, well, specifically religion was forced on blacks in America.

743 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:18.540
And a lot of blacks in Africa, Islam was forced Christianity was forced.

744 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:31.110
do they use or hebrew ism wasn't necessarily for they just went and found their way and the people around them started gravitate to them this is why you have people being accepted into

745 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:38.460
The tribes, the 12 tribes now, again, I could probably lose my job for saying that.

746 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:48.720
But this is what's in the Bible this is not to make anybody feel bad. And if you have never studied the Bible, you don't know who's a Jew and who's not.

747 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:57.780
Because the Bible specifically says there are people that think they're Jews, but are not and they're going to really catch hail.

748 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:05.520
And it tells you who the tribe of Jacob descended from him.

749 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:11.490
And the people that are, what about this picture.

750 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:16.050
Are we comfortable with death and murder?

751 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:23.070
You better get we better wake up then by tomorrow on the floor.

752 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:26.550
Since we all want this exercise to be.

753 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:33.330
And what are we also becoming desensitized to.

754 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:47.670
If you out with your daughter 5, year old daughter in this gay pride weekend, and you got to go to the store, because you're not a part of the community, and you come across and you see this. Now, you got to have a conversation with Jill, 56 year old that you not even ready.

755 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:56.100
You didn't even hear me I said you, you're not a part of the community you on your way to the store, and you come across the pride parade.

756 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.610
Or some venue where.

757 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.280
Now you got now, you got to have a conversation because little kids want to know stuff.

758 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:14.190
Look at the 1 next to it. Okay. What's the best.

759 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:20.490
Again, is this good or bad for the society?

760 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:27.630
I respect your elders or you just tolerate, em.

761 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:37.470
No, it shouldn't even be like that. They've been here longer. They've got that rapport there. Maybe you.

762 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:41.880
They have been here if it wasn't for them being here, you wouldn't be here.

763 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.440
So, give them their respect because the alphabet you get old.

764 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:51.300
And lose some of your faculties.

765 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:25:52.950 --> 01:26:00.090
Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about and you got some little young that's supposed to be respecting you.

766 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:00.090 --> 01:26:07.830
I'll move your old, you know, I'm like oh, yeah.

767 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:17.310
I suggest I would suggest those of you that are talking bad down about old people. I suggest you take a class called gerontology.

768 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:27.750
What is the gerontology study of old age? Because if if God, you will get old 1 day and you're going to be like, oh.

769 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:33.480
Okay, you'll understand.

770 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:43.110
And and basically, as a dermatologist, it would be my hope and desire that you start understanding. Now before you get old.

771 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:51.390
Because there is an old principle that says what goes around comes around. So, that means what.

772 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.450
You got to find out why they're mad at everybody.

773 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:26:54.450 --> 01:27:04.410
That's is anybody listening to me if you take this class called gerontology the study of old age, you're going to learn something about getting old.

774 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:14.250
You're young now, there's a lot of stuff you can handle this allows you just get them go do, but you get around 60, 70 years old.

775 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:19.590
You 820? No more you 830? No more.

776 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:24.090
You ain't 40 no more. You ain't 50? No more.

777 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:31.440
Now, somebody looking at you calling you. Oh, oh, you know.

778 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:44.490
You probably didn't grow up like that, but now you've got people talking to you crazy. It's like you becoming visible. It's because it's like, you become in the way and that will make you mad.

779 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.030
No distinct number 5.

To Bible nothing. Okay fellows.

783 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:06.810

784 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:10.980
That's not even Paula. I could barely get that word out.

785 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.550
So, who do you think this celibacy talk is aimed at it?

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:42.930
The firm in a marriage, we're all we're all taught to defer getting married.

791 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:53.520

They can take a lot agencies will raise the kids. I was young when my son was born, we could wrestle and do my my brother had his history.

795 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:28.170

You it takes energy to raise a kid.

812 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:25.620
Now, we're dealing with the new malthusian Bakers.

813 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:36.630

They came up with no abortion.

01:32:20.879 --> 01:32:26.699
Yeah, why ladies, if you want abortion, why you didn't get in there and fight for it.

822 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:26.699 --> 01:32:31.679
Because you're a minority, remember the 2 genders male.

823 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:35.549
That's what Yeah Yeah. Yeah.

824 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:35.549 --> 01:32:40.709
And then it got all this stuff for you to do. I don't know where it goes, but I guess it goes somewhere.

825 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:48.569
Yeah, so it's not telling the kitchen and this member people that's coming out because it's anonymous.

826 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:48.569 --> 01:32:57.029
Now, let me, let me introduce you to a Neal Malthus Mitt Romney.

827 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:32:58.319 --> 01:33:03.449

828 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:05.159 --> 01:33:13.679
According to Mitt Romney, he was heard saying this in a closed door meeting with rich, wealthy contributors. This is what he was caught saying.

829 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:13.679 --> 01:33:17.069
This may the new, this is why he didn't win the presidency by the way.

830 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:17.069 --> 01:33:21.929
Believe according to Mitt Romney, 47% of Americans.

831 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:33.809
Believe the government has responsibility to take care of them. They believe that they are entitled to health care to food to housing to you name it. I don't care about them. I care about, you.

832 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:34.829 --> 01:33:38.039
You know, he didn't win.

833 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:38.039 --> 01:33:41.069
When this when this got out.

834 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:41.069 --> 01:33:45.449
His approval ratings.

835 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:45.449 --> 01:33:49.169
Yeah, now if you if you've ever read.

836 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:49.169 --> 01:33:54.929
I can't think is the declaration of independence of the bill of rights. What I'm saying is.

837 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:59.879
The government is supposed to take care of the welfare.

838 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:33:59.879 --> 01:34:04.649
Of the of its people now, there are a lot of people that's not anything what they mean.

839 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:04.649 --> 01:34:08.729
Yes, it is, because most of them are on welfare.

840 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:08.729 --> 01:34:11.849
But other groups of people, they want to.

841 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:11.849 --> 01:34:16.409
Spine me that hold it back.

842 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:16.409 --> 01:34:26.909
They don't want minorities to have adequate housing, adequate health care. So when he put this number out there, 47%, he was just talking about the dominant group.

843 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:28.199 --> 01:34:33.059
Because there are white, poor people that rich white people don't like.

844 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:33.059 --> 01:34:37.709
Don't even hang out with you because they are like, you a pool in your weight.

845 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:44.279
You're white in America you supposed to be up here with us you need to get it together so they don't mean fool with them.

846 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:44.279 --> 01:34:51.359
So, they are part of this 47% Latinos are part of this 47%, right? Along with.

847 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:34:51.359 --> 01:35:03.389
Blacks Neal Malthus, they came the new thinking, the new malthusian thinkers came up with 7 suggestions.

848 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:03.389 --> 01:35:09.029
To curtail, or to control population look look at these carefully.

849 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:09.029 --> 01:35:13.889
Make it more practical for people to postpone, or void marriage.

850 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:13.889 --> 01:35:19.709
Haven't they done that? Did anybody graduate? The 1st thing on your mind is getting married.

851 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:23.219
Or was it I got to get a job go to work.

852 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:23.219 --> 01:35:29.039
Number 2 reward, non family lifestyles.

853 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:29.039 --> 01:35:39.119
By removing the penalties for being single divorced or widowed. Now, what type of lifestyle do you think a single person is? Living a life?

854 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:39.119 --> 01:35:46.049
They do whatever they want. Right? So, take the label away from somebody that you think is doing too much.

855 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:46.049 --> 01:35:50.279
Let them do what they want to do. Hmm.

856 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:35:50.279 --> 01:36:03.479
We look at divorce people like, oh, it was delayed bad for until you didn't take the penalties away you free. Now you single now now you have people having parties divorce parties yes.

857 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:16.229
Number 3, restrict tax exemptions were dependent children, paying maternity leave and family allowances mess around get pregnant. If you want to.

858 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:16.524 --> 01:36:31.164
you on your own dime abolished public housing grants tied to family size and fellowships for married students marriage students used to get paid to come to college bring your family we have a whole dormitory just for families married

859 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:31.164 --> 01:36:33.504
couples they said no i'm going to do that no more

860 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:40.379
It's given people too much of an advantage remove penalties.

861 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:40.379 --> 01:36:45.989
For engaging in non procreative, sexual relations.

862 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:47.759 --> 01:36:51.449
that means you give the age with six that i'm going to produce no child

863 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:51.449 --> 01:36:57.749
Promote that type of sexual relation promote it.

864 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:36:57.749 --> 01:37:10.499
Number 6 designate population a problem for ministries of economics and education, rather than ministries of health. So you all know you can get a disease.

865 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:10.499 --> 01:37:14.099
Health, let's stop talking about that.

866 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:14.099 --> 01:37:17.939
Let's talk about how much money it costs to be in a relationship.

867 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:17.939 --> 01:37:22.949
We're trying to curtail growth population growth.

868 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:34.949
this is why this why people don't date long because somebody wants somebody to pay all the day on time where somebody got to be going somewhere you can't just sit home and watch tv

869 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:36.389 --> 01:37:40.829
It costs money to date and how much money you make it.

870 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:40.829 --> 01:37:45.809
Not enough to be the day to take somebody out every day or every weekend.

871 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:45.809 --> 01:37:50.069
Redefine traditional family.

872 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:50.069 --> 01:37:55.589
Particularly for women and allow everyone the right.

873 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:37:55.589 --> 01:38:01.679
The education and gainful employment. Now, Here's your conflict theory at work.

874 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:01.679 --> 01:38:07.469
Because there's not enough jobs so what's going to happen if there's not enough jobs.

875 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:08.819 --> 01:38:12.059
There's going to be a fight over the job.

876 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:19.169
Competition favoritism a lot of times went out cause there's a whole saying what, you know, but who, you know.

877 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:20.609 --> 01:38:25.259
And you don't spend all this money going to college, get your degree.

878 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:25.259 --> 01:38:32.219
But the person that got the job is as dumb as the door knob, because they live on the same street as the person that hired.

879 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:36.089 --> 01:38:41.159
Now, you got to go figure out something else to do. Oh, and don't forget to pay your student loans.

880 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:43.049 --> 01:38:48.629
Stress theme Neo malpass.

881 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:56.489
Any questions? No questions.

882 "Michael Ayers" (879405312)
01:39:00.119 --> 01:39:01.332
Why am I annoying?
